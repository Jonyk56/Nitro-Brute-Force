# Nitro-Brute-Force
Get some sweet Nitro Codes by Bruteforcing them !

You can get nitros code by bruteforcing requests !
Here is the Source code to prouve that it isn't a malware or some kind of trojan.

## Requirements
* proxies.txt (Fill it with the maximum amount of proxies) or just Generate some
* Python 3.6.x or higher (Just for the new imports)
* main.py (you can clone it if you have git with `git clone https://github.com/Lygaen/Nitro-Brute-Force` or just download it)
* Know what kind of proxies you have (HTTP,...), by default, the Integrated Proxy Scraper generate SOCKS5 Proxies

And that's it ! Hope you like the Sweet Nitros Code

## Setup

Here are the line you need to do to make it work properly :
`git clone https://github.com/Lygaen/Nitro-Brute-Force`
`cd Nitro-Brute-Force`
`python main.py`

or if you prefer complicated thing, the one line command :
`git clone https://github.com/Lygaen/Nitro-Brute-Force & cd Nitro-Brute-Force & python main.py`

## For the Future
- [ ] Make a GUI
- [ ] Post it on PyPi
- [x] Make a proxy scraper
- [ ] ~~Destroy the world with free nitros code~~
